- A new system can be created

- After creating a system the user is advised to create the Action for connecting to a running system

- When all the required fields of the System are filled the tab Windows is shown

- In the Windows tab a new Window can be added to the System by adding another window and clicking on the plus icon

- When a Window is attached to a System, the delete-Button of that System will disappear for as long, as a Window is attached.
  
- The delete-Button will reappear as soon as there is no longer a Window attached to the System.

- A system can be deleted (if there is no window attached to it).
-> If deleting the object does not cause consistency problems: >> "Durch das Löschen von System "..." würden keine weiteren Objekte gelöscht. Möchten Sie fortfahren?" >> Ja // Nein

- A System can now be assigned to a user. In that case if a user is assigned to a system, that user can
  see all the related items of that system. He cannot see items related to systems he is not assigned to.
